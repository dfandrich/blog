# Choices

In software we are always discussing how to solve problems. We try, we change, we develop new tools 
and languages to get a grip on the complexities we need to master. This has proven to be an excellent
way to make progress. And there is no reason to expect that to stop anytime soon.

The discussions often become heated, involving opinions, egos, excuses, personal stakes and
life choices. We are all humans. And some passionate heat is ok. We can love or hate a tool,
a language, an operating system. That's fine.

We leave the area of fruitful discourse behind when the culture wars start. When other
people are "dumb" or "unethical" or get other demeaning labels attached, when camps are
built and stakes are raised, it is done to end debate. If you are on possession of the
One Truth, other opinions become heresies.

This is not a good situation. If you look at human history, ruling by dogmas
has a very bad track record.

**tl;dr**

Have opinions. Love what you do. It's ok to hate what others like. But that does not make you the superior. Nor the expert on the situation they are in.
